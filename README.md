Basic MVC structure

This is the basic structure I generally use when I'm starting with PHP Projects. It allows the developer to easily create new functions and sections in the system while making use of pretty URLs throughout.
The code is fully commented and explained, with index.php making the initial call to the bootstrap. The bootstrap is what handles the parsing of the URL and makes the requests as needed to the controllers and functions.
